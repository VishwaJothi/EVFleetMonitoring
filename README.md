# EV_Fleet_Monitoring_And_Predictive_Analysis
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for managing electric vehicle (EV) fleets with real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. 
Designed to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and support sustainability goals, this system provides fleet managers with critical insights and tools to manage EV performance, optimize routes, and schedule maintenance proactively.

# Result
1. Efficient Fleet Management: Optimize vehicle performance and reduce operational cost.
2. Synthetic Data: Enables reliable testing without real fleet data.
3. Machine Learning: Predicts range with respect to battery level.
4. Impact: Improves fleet efficiency, reduces cost, and supports EV adoption.
